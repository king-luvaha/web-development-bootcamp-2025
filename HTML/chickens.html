            The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a> of
            Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as
            pets[1] or for cockfighting.

                Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
            Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and thewings are short.<sup>[19]</sup> Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly morethan a short distance.<sup>[20]</sup> Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[19] Newly-hatched chicks of both modern andheritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same age.

                <h2>Reproduction and life-cycle</h2>
                <p>
                    To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[34] The dance triggers a response in the hen[34] and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the male does a tail-bending display
